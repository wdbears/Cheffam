# Cheffam
## What is Cheffam?
Cheffam is a freelancing platform for local chefs. 

Feeling hungry and not wanting to order take out? Homesick? Wanting to try something new? Cheffam's got you covered. 

Cheffam pairs local chefs with people in their vicinity looking for grub. The user puts in a request (e.g. - homemade pizza) and a chef can accept the request if they're willing.

As far as pricing goes, chefs can price their products the way they see fit.

Cheffam is meant to drive community engagement up with the concept of followings. Each chef has a following that users can choose to back. The bigger the following, the more popular the chef. This allows local chefs to more easily gain recognition for their talents while having a steady flow of income.
